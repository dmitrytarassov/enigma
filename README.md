# Enigma Encryption Machine Project

## About the Project
This project aims to implement and compare different approaches to building the Enigma encryption machine using various programming languages. The goal is to explore how different languages handle the complexities of encryption and to understand the nuances in each implementation.

## Setting Up the Testing Environment
To set up the test environment, follow these steps:

### Prepare Test Environment:
- Run the command `make prepare`.

This will create a test text file of 1MB size, which can be used for testing purposes.

## Implementation in C++
### Building the Project
Use the command `make build-cpp` to compile the C++ implementation of the Enigma machine.

### Testing
To test the Enigma machine with the previously created test file, run `make test-cpp`.

### Debugging
For debugging the C++ implementation, use `make debug-cpp`.
